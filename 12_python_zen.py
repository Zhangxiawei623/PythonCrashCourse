"The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters"
"Beautiful is better than ugly."
"Explicit is better than implicit."
"Simple is better than complex."
"Complex is better than complicated."
"Flat is better than nested."
"Sparse is better than dense."
"Readability counts."
"Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules."
"Although practicality beats purity."
"Errors should never pass silently."
"Unless explicitly silenced."
"In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess."
"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
"Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch."
"Now is better than never."
"Although never is often better than *right* now."
"If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea."
"If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea."
"Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"

# 《Python之禅，蒂姆·彼得斯》
# 优美胜于丑陋，显式胜于隐式。
# 简洁胜于复杂，复杂胜于凌乱。
# 平滑胜于嵌套，稀疏胜于密集。
# 可读性很重要。
# 特殊情况并不特殊，无法打破常规，尽管实用性胜过纯洁性。
# 错误永远不应该默默地过去，除非明确沉默。
# 面对模棱两可，拒绝猜测的诱惑。
# 应该有一种——最好只有一种——明显的方法来做到这一点。
# 虽然这种方法一开始可能并不明显，除非你是 Python之父！
# 做也许好过不做，但不假思索就动手还不如不做。
# 如果实现很难解释，那是个坏主意。
# 如果实现很容易解释，那可能是个好主意。
# 命名空间是一个很好的想法--可以让我们做更多的事情！
